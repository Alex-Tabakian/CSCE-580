   - Q1a: 
     - comments:
     - marks: 2 + 10 + 8 = 20
   - Q2: 
     - comments: Good effort! However, we requested all data, prompt and code used in the analysis
       But prompt / code was missing. Hence, marks deducted as appropriate.
       For pre-processing with data, how did you get .pdf when it was images (.jpg)?
     - marks: 10 + 0 + (10 + 10 + 10 + 10) + 10
   - Total: 20 + 60 = 80
     (Out of 120, will be scaled later)
