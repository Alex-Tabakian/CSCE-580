"Mix all the dry ingredients except the salt, then add half the water.",
"Stir it with chopsticks, if you have them.",
"Wait a few minutes, and then add the rest of the water.",
"If it is too sticky, add more garbanzo bean flour.",
"It should be just a little sticky, and a little softer than playdough.",
"Before you start, get a little bowl of salt, a bowl of oil and a brush, and some starch for the counter.",
"Dust the counter and your rolling pin with tapioca starch and pinch off about a sixth of the dough.",
"Roll it out to about 1/4 inch thick, then brush it with oil and sprinkle it with a little salt.",
"Now roll it up like a taco, and then like a snail.",
"Put some more starch on the counter and roll it to 1/4 inch again.",
"Put it on a sheet of plastic wrap, then do the rest of them the same.",
"Pour about 1/8 inch of oil into a pan and heat it up.",
"Carefully place a flatbread in the oil.",
"Cook it for a few minutes, then very carefully turn it over.",
"It will be slightly dark golden when it is done.",
"Be careful not to burn it, because it smells terrible when burned.",
"If you doubled the recipe, you should change or strain the oil in the middle.",
"Put the finished flatbreads on a paper towel to drain the oil off.",
"Eat it with whatever topping you like while it is still warm.",
"Put the leftovers in the fridge.",
"The leftovers can be toasted or microwaved.",
"The topping in the picture is ground lamb, onions and swiss chard.",
"Another good topping is lamb, coconut yogurt, onions and tamarind paste.",
"You can also use them for sandwiches or tostadas.",
"They go quite good with any savory food, but not with sweet things."
