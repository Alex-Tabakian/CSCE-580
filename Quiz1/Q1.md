a) What is open data? Given an example of open data that you produce which others can use?

Open data is data that is accessible for everyone to use. It is useful for training artificial intelligence models because the computer scientists donâ€™t have to manually collect the data themselves.

Filling out the census would be an example of contributing to open data. The results get published by the government which anyone could use.

You are analyzing a dataset and some attributes are missing.
    b.1) What could be any 2 reasons why they are missing?

        The data was never collected.
        The data was lost or got corrupted
    b.2) What are any 2 ways you can still proceed with data 
    analysis despite the missing values. For each, mention what assumption you are making and what are its risks.

        Remove row/col with missing data
        Assumption: The missing data occurs randomly
        Risk: Deleting data reduces the sample size therefor reducing statistical power

        Replace missing data with median, mean, or mode
        Assumption: Missing values are close to the overall median
        Risk: Bias can be created if the data is not missing at random
